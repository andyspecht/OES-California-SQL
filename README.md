# OES-California-SQL
Database of 2011-2016 OES California Wage Data

This project compiles the data for years 2011-2016 found on the [CA Employment Development Department website](http://www.labormarketinfo.edd.ca.gov/data/oes-employment-and-wages.html). There is a .bak that has the data in a SQL Server database. The database structure is described [here](https://andyspecht.github.io/2017-01-29-new-project-wages-ca). If you don't want to use SQL Server, I have also included an Excel workbook with four spreadsheets: one with the data for each table plus the SQL for creating the tables and view.
